// The component is structured similarly to the other components in the application, with a container, page header, and card layout.
// The page header includes a title, and the card body contains a placeholder paragraph.
// The component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
// The component is styled using CSS classes that are consistent with the rest of the application.
// The component is a functional component that uses React's JSX syntax to define the structure and content of the page.
