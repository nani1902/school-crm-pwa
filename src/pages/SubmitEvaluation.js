// This code defines a React component for submitting an evaluation. It uses React Router's useParams hook to get the lead ID from the URL and provides a back button to navigate to the lead's details page. The component includes a header and a card layout for the evaluation form, which is currently a placeholder.
// The component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application. The styling and structure are consistent with the rest of the application, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
// The component is designed to be part of a larger application, likely a CRM or lead management system, where users can submit evaluations for leads.
// The placeholder text indicates that the form will be implemented in the future, and the current version serves as a basic structure for the page.
// The component is styled using Bootstrap classes, ensuring a responsive and modern design. The use of icons from Material Icons adds a visual element to the buttons, enhancing the user interface.
// The component is a functional component, utilizing React hooks for state management and routing. It is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for future enhancements and features.
