// This code defines a React component for a "Verify Payment" page. It uses React Router's `useParams` hook to get the lead ID from the URL parameters. The component includes a header with a title and a back button that navigates to the lead's details page. The main content area contains a placeholder for the payment verification form.
// The component is styled using Bootstrap classes for layout and design. The back button uses the `Link` component from React Router to navigate to the lead's details page, passing the lead ID in the URL. The card component is used to group related content and provide a clean layout.
// The component is exported as the default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
// The placeholder text indicates that the form for verifying payment will be implemented in the future, and the current version serves as a basic structure for the page.
// The component is designed to be part of a larger application, likely a CRM or lead management system, where users can verify payments for leads.
// The component is a functional component, utilizing React hooks for state management and routing. It is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for future enhancements and features.
// The component is styled using Bootstrap classes, ensuring a responsive and modern design. The use of icons from Material Icons adds a visual element to the buttons, enhancing the user interface.
